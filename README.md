Professor @hplantin often teaches [CS-212 at Calvin
College](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/212/hplantin/). As the
semester goes on, he uncomments/renames anchor elements in [the
syllabus](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/212/hplantin/syllabus.html)
to reveal future projects. One such project, Project 4, Bingo, is
[described](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/212/hplantin/projects/P4-Bingo.pdf)
(a backup is saved to this repo) and the student is given [seed
code](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/212/hplantin/projects/prog4.zip)
(this repository will contain a commit identical to that zip) for
implementing the project.

[This repository](https://github.com/binki/calvin-cs212-bingo)’s
purpose is to improve upon that seed code to make it more exemplary.

1. Follow the widely accepted best practices and conventions for the
   languages and tools used. For example, a C# class would use
   properties rather than getter methods.

2. Be as functional as it should be.

3. Follow guidelines on how to write good code disseminated by
   professors. For example, students are encouraged to use Test
   Driven Development.

Of course, improvements are expected to be sporadic and few. But if
you have any ideas, please open an issue, etc. Hopefully @hplantin
takes it over and uses the suggestions next semester…?
